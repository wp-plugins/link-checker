An easy to use link checker for WordPress to detect broken internal and external links on your website.

== Description ==
The [Link Checker](https://www.marcobeierer.com/wordpress-plugins/link-checker) for WordPress uses an external service to crawl your website and and find broken links on your website. 

In contrast to search engine tools like the Google Search Console, which only show if a URL on your website is not reachable, it does not matter for the Link Checker if the links leads to an internal or external URL. The Link Checker will find all dead links. 

The Link Checker works for every plugin out of the box. The computation costs for your website is also very low because the crawler does the heavy work and just acts like a normal visitor, who visits all pages of you website once.

= Features =
* Simple setup.
* Works out of the box with all WordPress plugins.
* Low computation costs for your webserver.

= Technical Features =
* Respects your robots.txt file (also the crawl-delay directive).

= Upcoming Technical Features =
* Support for checking the availability of embedded images, videos, CSS files and JS files.

= Limitations =
During the beta phase the service is limited to check the first 500 URLs of your website. After the beta phase, you could buy a token to check up to 50000 URLs. If you already need more URLs, please contact me by email.

= Use of an External Server =
The Link Checker uses an external server, operated by the developer of the plugin, to crawl your website and detect broken links. This means, that there is some communication between your website and the server. The only data that is communicated to the external server by your website is the URL of your website and the fact that you are using WordPress. The server than crawlers your website (as a normal visitor does) and answers with a list of the found broken links.

== Installation ==
1. Upload the 'link-checker' folder to the '/wp-content/plugins/' directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. Access the generator with the "Link Checker" button in the sidebar and use the "Check your website" button to start the process. 
4. The found broken links will be reported to you when the crawler has finished.
